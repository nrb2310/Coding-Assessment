#Q5)
# Our football team has finished the championship. Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a
# string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score. For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...] Points are awarded for each match as follows:
# if x > y: 3 points (win)
# if x < y: 0 points (loss)
# if x = y: 1 point (tie)
# We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.
# Notes:
# our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
# 0 <= x <= 4
# 0 <= y <= 4
