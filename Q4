# Q4)
# Create a Vector class with x and y attributes that represent component magnitudes in the x and y directions. Your vectors should handle vector additon with an  
# .add() method that takes a second vector as an argument and returns a new vector equal to the sum of the vector you call .add() on and the vector you pass in.

class Vector:
  def __init__(self, x, y):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
  
  def add(self,V2):
    
    x_sum = V1.x + V2.x
    y_sum = V1.y + V2.y

    print("\nSum Vector is: ("+str(x_sum)+","+str(y_sum)+")")

V1 = Vector(3,4)
V2 = Vector(1,2)

print("\n1st Vector: ")
print("X-Magnitude: "+str(V1.x))
print("Y-Magnitude: "+str(V1.y))

print("\n2nd Vector: ")
print("X-Magnitude: "+str(V2.x))
print("Y-Magnitude: "+str(V2.y))

print("\nVector Sum: ")
V1.add(V2)
