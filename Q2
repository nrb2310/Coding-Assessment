# Q2)
# Background : 
# You're modelling the interaction between a large number of quarks and have decided to create a Quark class so you can generate your own quark objects.
# Quarks are fundamental particles and the only fundamental particle to experience all four fundamental forces.

# Your task
# Your Quark class should allow you to create quarks of any valid color ("red", "blue", and "green") and any valid flavor ('up', 'down', 'strange', 'charm', 'top', and 'bottom').
# Every quark has the same baryon_number (BaryonNumber in C#): 1/3. Every quark should have an .interact() (.Interact() in C#) method that allows any quark to
# interact with another quark via the strong force. When two quarks interact they exchange colors. This example is in python, but please do this exercise in PHP.

# NOTE: I DON'T REALLY HAVE EXPOSURE TO PHP PROGRAMMING SO I AM CONTINUING THE PROGRAM IN PYTHON.
